# Trajectory analysis ( TrajAn )

TrajAn is a Python package with functionality to handle trajectory datasets following the CF-conventions on trajectories:
http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.10/cf-conventions.html#trajectory-data

Trajectory datasets contain position time series from e.g. drifting buoys, or output from lagrangian models.
